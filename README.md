(I used the Almendra font family)

## What does it do?

It transpiles Shakespearean English into valid JavaScript.

## How to use it

* Install `npm install babel-plugin-thy-script --save`
* Set up babel and add `babel-plugin-thy-script` to your list of plugins
* Become Shakespeare -- bring forth your poetic side as you code. Use the options outlined in [Options](#options). Then run your build command to make your poetry readable for the commonfolk. Look for the compiled scripture (regular javascript) wherever you set the output to go (in our example below, it'll be in `lib/compiled.js`)

In case you need more detailed instructions than that:

To set up babel, create a `babel.config.json` file and add the following to it:

```json
{
    "presets": [
        [
            "@babel/preset-env",
            {
                "targets": {
                    "edge": "17",
                    "firefox": "60",
                    "chrome": "67",
                    "safari": "11.1"
                },
                "useBuiltIns": "usage",
                "corejs": "3.6.5"
            }
        ]
    ],
    "plugins": ["babel-plugin-glowup-vibes"]
}
```

Add something like this to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel ./src/script.js --out-file ./lib/compiled.js"
},
```

Note: Like Glowup Vibes, this was made using Babel 7 and untested on anything else. No guarantees that this is totally flawless.

## Contributing

Bring forth PRs if you thou hath good additions.

If you want to contribute, but you don't know where to start, that's great! Watch this YouTube video to learn more about Babel plugins: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK6n0pYcOe8>

AST explorer is also a great tool to learn about ASTs and test some of your ideas. <https://astexplorer.net/>

When you submit a PR, don't forget to update the table in the README along with the appropriate code in example.js.

## Does this exist in (insert coding language)?

Alas, a plugin such as this for another language is unbeknownst to me.
